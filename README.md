# NASA Image of The Day Wallpaper

This is a simple utility that just sets your desktop background to the latest [NASA image of the day](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html). If you add this to your startup applications it will run when you login and make sure you've always got the latest NASA image for your wallpaper!

This *should* work on Windows, MacOS, and Linux, but I've only tested on Linux so far. I don't have automated release builds yet, but you can download the builds I manually made for Windows and Linux from the [pre-release](https://github.com/zicklag/nasa-iotd-wallpaper/releases/tag/pre-release).

I did this in like an hour, but it was kind of fun. It might actually make a fun beginner Rust tutorial almost, but I probably don't have time to write it. ðŸ˜œ
